# import string

# A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example,
# the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram,
# because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

# Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

# Define the function.
